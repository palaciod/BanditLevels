# BanditLevels
Currently obssessed with the bandit mini game siris. The game is located in http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit8.html. The game can be completed with unix command lines only, but wheres the fun in that? So I decided to finish some of the levels by creating my own code that can complete the task for me.
